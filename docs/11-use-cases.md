# Use Cases

## 1. Data Center Server Security
Secure boot verification and continuous attestation for every server in the fleet.

## 2. Supply Chain Verification
Prove hardware authenticity from manufacturing through deployment — detect tampered components before they enter production.

## 3. Secure Firmware Updates
Authenticated, dual-bank firmware updates with automatic rollback on failure. No bricked devices.

## 4. Platform Composition Attestation
Verify the entire stack — from PRoT hardware through BMC firmware to host OS — as a single trust chain.

## 5. Air-Gapped Environments
The local verifier enables trust decisions without external network access, critical for classified or isolated deployments.

## 6. Multi-Vendor Platforms
Mix and match PRoT hardware from different vendors while maintaining a single, standard firmware stack.
